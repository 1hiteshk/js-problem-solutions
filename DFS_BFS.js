You want to find your lost toy in your house:
DFS: You go into one room and search every corner deeply before trying another room.
BFS: You peek into every room on the first floor before going upstairs.

| Search Type | How it Searches                   | Good For                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| DFS         | Go deep, then backtrack           | Searching paths, puzzles |
| BFS         | Check level by level (wide first) | Finding shortest path    |

/* 
ðŸ”¹ 1. BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Data structure used â†’ Queue (FIFO: First In, First Out).
Reason: BFS explores level by level (neighbors first, then their children).
A queue ensures nodes are visited in the order they were discovered.

Steps (simplified):-
- Start with a root/starting node â†’ push it into a queue.
- Pop from the front of the queue, process it.
- Push its unvisited neighbors into the queue.
- Repeat until the queue is empty.

ðŸ‘‰ BFS guarantees shortest path in an unweighted graph.

/* 
2. DFS (Depth-First Search)

Data structure used â†’ Stack (LIFO: Last In, First Out).
Implementation options:
- Explicit Stack (iterative DFS).
- Call Stack (recursive DFS).

Reason: DFS goes deep first, meaning we always explore the latest discovered node until dead end,
 then backtrack.

Steps (simplified):-
- Start with a root/starting node â†’ push it into a stack (or call recursively).
- Pop from stack / recursive call â†’ process it.
- Push its unvisited neighbors into the stack (or recurse).
- `Repeat until the stack is empty (or recursion unwinds).

ðŸ‘‰ DFS is useful for pathfinding, cycle detection, topological sort, etc.
