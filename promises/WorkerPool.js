/*
A Worker Pool manages multiple worker threads to process tasks concurrently 
while limiting the number of workers running at the same time. 
Approach
1. Use a Queue (taskQueue) to manage incoming tasks.
2. Use a Counter (activeWorkers) to track running tasks.
3. When run (taskFunction) is called:
   If available, execute immediately and increment activeWorkers.
   Otherwise, enqueue the task for later execution.
4. When a task finishes:
   Decrement activeWorkers.
   Start the next task from taskQueue if available.

This code defines a WorkerPool class that allows you to control the concurrency
of async task executions â€” useful when you want to run only a certain number of tasks simultaneously.
