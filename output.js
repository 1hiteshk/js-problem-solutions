// Output order: 1,3,0, 10, 4, 9,undefined, 7, 8, 2
// Explanation: 
// 1. Synchronous logs (1,3, 0) are executed first.
// 2. `process.nextTick` runs before any microtasks, logging 10.
// 3. The first microtask logs 4 after the await.
// 4. The promise resolves to 9, logging it next.
// 5. The next microtask logs 8.
// 6. Finally, the macrotask logs 2.

//‚ùå process.nextTick does not exist in browsers, so it's simulated or polyfilled (and behaves like a microtask, not a true nextTick)

/* ‚úÖ In Browser/Programiz:
process.nextTick is not native

Likely polyfilled as a Promise.then(...), which is a microtask, not a nextTick

It gets queued after the current microtasks, not before

‚úÖ In Node.js:
process.nextTick() runs before any other microtasks

That's why '10' appears right after 0 in Node */

/* üëâ A microtask is not guaranteed to run immediately after another microtask ‚Äî only
 that it runs after the current call stack and in the order it was enqueued. */
